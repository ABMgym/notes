# Weekly Sync
## Feb 29
- Reading papers
- Running code:
  codebase:
  - https://github.com/drimpossible/corrective-unlearning-bench
    
  baselines:
  - https://github.com/MadryLab/backdoor_data_poisoning
  - https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox/blob/main/notebooks/poisoning_defense_activation_clustering.ipynb

Next Steps:
- run baselines
- think about detecting methods

## March 9
Andy is working on Activation Clustering \
Saiteja is working on Feature Covariance \
Jiawei is integrating these baselines into corrective benchmark framework and trying new detection methods.
Also, submit a request to CAIS for GPU access

## March 13
We are stucked with GPU access

## March 22
Jiawei has already implemented 2 baselines in the corective unlearning benchmark, currently working with the code to visualize the comparison of different unlearning methods. \
Andy is learning influential function. \
We have GPU access from CAIS cluster. Waiting to be added to the cluster.
