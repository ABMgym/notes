### Current Poison Setup
The dataset I'm using is CIFAR-10 including 50,000 training images and 10,000 valid images. 

The model is ResNet.

The poison method is adding a pixel of value = (101, 0, 25) at the "center" of a image, specifically the position is [11, 16] of a 32 * 32 three-channel image

The target to be poisoned is images of number "9", by adding the above trigger, we flip the corresponding labels to "4". 

About the size to poison: I currently randomly select 500 images from the class = 9. (i.e. the poison rate = 1%)

In this setup, the model trained with poisoned data achieve 83.05% acc on clean test examples and 90.70% acc on examples with trigger, which means the attack is successful.
